    Settings for workcraft. The default values are:
        DB_PEON_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL: 5
            This is the interval at which the peon sends a heartbeat to the database.

        DB_POLLING_INTERVAL: 5
            This is the interval at which the peon polls the database for new tasks.

        DB_POLLING_INTERVAL_RANDOMNESS_MEAN: 0
            This is the mean of the randomness added to the polling interval.
            (To avoid race conditions with other workers)

        DB_POLLING_INTERVAL_RANDOMNESS_STDDEV: 0
            This is the std. deviation of the randomness added to the polling interval.
            (To avoid race conditions with other workers)

        DB_SETUP_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER_SECONDS: 60
            This is the multiplier for the exponential backoff algorithm.

        DB_SETUP_BACKOFF_MAX_SECONDS: 3600
            This is the maximum backoff time for the exponential backoff algorithm.

        DB_SETUP_RUN_SELF_CORRECT_TASK_INTERVAL: 10
            This is the interval at which the database runs the self-correct task.

        DB_SETUP_RUN_REOPEN_FAILED_TASK_INTERVAL: 10
            This is the interval at which the database reopens failed tasks.

        DB_SETUP_WAIT_TIME_BEFORE_WORKER_DECLARED_DEAD: 60
            This is the time the database waits before declaring a worker dead.

        DB_SETUP_CHECK_DEAD_WORKER_INTERVAL: 10
            This is the interval at which the database checks for dead workers.

    These values are read from the workcraft.config.json file.
